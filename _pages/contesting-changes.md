## Two Unsuccessful Contests

Teams will be allowed a maximum of two unsuccessful contests. After two unsuccessful contests, a team will not be allowed to present any more contests. No foul will be assessed for requesting additional contests.
 
## Announcing

Scorekeepers should announce when a team has two unsuccessful contests. (Note that failure to announce this is not grounds for a contest.)
 
## Timekeeping

When a team initiates a contest, the timekeeper will first set a 30-second timer. Upon expiration, if the team has an available timeout, they may elect to use the timeout instead of continuing the contest. In this case, no additional time will be given, a timeout will be deducted, no unsuccessful contest will be given, and the match will resume.
 
If the team elects to continue the contest (either by starting to present before the 30 second timer expires or by stating their intention to continue after the timer expires), they will be given 2 additional minutes to present after the 30 second timer expires.
 
## Multi-Issue Contests

Teams may present validity as part of a multi-issue contest. If validity is presented in a multi-issue contest, officials must vote on the validity issue first.


## Important notes

1. All other contesting rules are in effect.
2. This takes place immediately for all 2023 District Finals (all divisions) and continues through National Finals.
