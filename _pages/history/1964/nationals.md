### Individuals

The second National Bible Quiz Tournament in 1964 did not announce the top quizzers. The tournament was single elimination meaning that the maximum number of quizzes a team could play was 3. Therefore, it is difficult to determine who was the top quizzer. James Johnson of [Burlington A/G, Burlington, NC](#southeast-region), was the captain and top scorer of the team which won the tournament.
