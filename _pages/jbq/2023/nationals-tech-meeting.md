# Quiz Competitions: Easier and Faster

There are FREE resources for all coordinators in Bible Quiz and JBQ:

* [Registration](https://registration.biblequiz.com) is free and easy. If you are a coordinator wanting to use it, create a login and leave a feedback message. Someone will contact you.
* [ScoreKeep](/apps) is a scorekeeping app (currently only available on Windows). It feeds directly off the registration data to create a schedule and manage all scorekeeping for a competition.
* [EZScore](/apps) is a scoring app (Android or Windows) used to enter the actual scores during a match. The scores are posted online for coaches and spectators to watch the live scores.

The team behind all this software is hosting a meeting to discuss the current state and what new stuff is coming next.
